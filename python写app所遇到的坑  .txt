Now that python is installed, open the Command line and make sure python is available by typing python --version. Then, do the following to install.

    Ensure you have the latest pip and wheel:

    python -m pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools

    Install the dependencies (skip gstreamer (~90MB) if not needed, see Kivy°Øs dependencies):

    python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew \
    kivy.deps.gstreamer --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/packages/simple/

    Install kivy:

    python -m pip install kivy

This has been fixed. It was a problem with the website that served the gstreamer wheels. Also, we enabled https for kivy.org so the command to use is now 
python -m pip install docutils pygments pypiwin32 kivy.deps.sdl2 kivy.deps.glew kivy.deps.gstreamer --extra-index-url https://kivy.org/downloads/packages/simple/
